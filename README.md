# Hey there! 👋 I'm Arnav Singh

> "Code like it's your superpower — because it kinda is."

## 🚀 About Me
- 👨‍💻 A curious coder who's down to build **literally anything** you throw at me (as long as it's code 😄)
- 🌱 Currently diving deep into the **MERN stack** — MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js
- 🛠️ Backend wizard-in-training, always down to debug dragons and optimize chaos
- 🤝 Looking to collaborate on **open-source** and full-stack projects (with a backend twist)
- 📫 You can summon me at: **itzarnavbruh@gmail.com**

## 🧩 Fun Facts
- 🎮 Built a *Pokémon-style game* in Unity with custom C# scripting
- ⚙️ I like servers, APIs, CLI tools, and anything that sounds like it belongs in a cyberpunk terminal
- 🧠 Always experimenting with Rust, DevOps, and low-level black magic

## 📍 Find me plotting code on:
- GitHub (obviously)
- Stack Overflow (in the trenches)
- Your console logs (👻)
